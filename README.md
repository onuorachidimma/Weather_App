# **Class Work: Build a Simple Weather App**

## **Task: Build a basic weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

### **Instructions:**
1. **City Input:**
   - Include an input field where users can enter the name of a city.
   - The input field should have an associated "Get Weather" button.

2. **Weather Display:**
   - Display the current temperature and weather condition for the entered city.
   - You can use a free weather API for this task or hard code the weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle cases where the entered city is not found or the API request fails (or not found in your hard coded data).
   - Display a simple error message in such cases.

4. **Simple Styling:**
   - Apply basic styling to make the app visually appealing.

### **Evaluation Criteria:**
- Correct implementation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Proper usage of input fields and buttons.
- Integration with a weather API to fetch and display data.
- Handling of errors and displaying informative messages.
- Basic styling to make the app look presentable.

**Note:** You have three hours to complete this task. Please provide the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate sections, and make sure to test the app to ensure its functionality.

**Do this as a group and send the link to your group repository.**
